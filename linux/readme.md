# Linux API
To use the linux API head over to the [Linux API Repo](https://github.com/TheCrafters001/apis/tree/master/linux) and type in the following command

```curl -ssl https://api.thecrafters001.ga/linux/(os-base)/(category)/(FileName).sh | bash```
Where (FileName) should be where you enter your file, (os-base) should be what your OS is based on, and (category) is what catagory you want.

## Example
If you want to update your system (Ubuntu-based example) you would type
```curl -ssl https://api.thecrafters001.ga/linux/ubuntu/system/update-system.sh | bash```
